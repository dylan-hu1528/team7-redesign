course_description:
- This one-credit hour, S/U grade, online course will discuss the recent advances in computer security, covering a variety of advanced topics including (1) hardware security such as Row-Hammer, Meltdown, Spectra, and Foreshadow attacks; (2) software security such as code reuse attacks, binary code disassembling/reassembling, and fuzzing; (3) IoT security such as smarthome, and Bluetooth security; and (4) mobile security such as Android systems security and robocalls. Thirteen distinguished speakers across the globe (9 USA, 3 Europe, and 1 Asia-pacific) have been invited to deliver the weekly lecture via zoom on every Friday at 11AM (to accommodate the different time zones). Students enrolled in this class are expected to attend the lectures and ask questions. There will be no homeworks and exams.
