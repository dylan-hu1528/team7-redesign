aboutMe:
  - I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at The Ohio State University (OSU).  I am also a faculty member at Translational Data Analytics Institute (TDAI), Center for Automotive Research (CAR), and the recently launched Institute for Cybersecurity and Digital Trust (ICDT).
  - My primary research interests are program (e.g., binary code, byte code, or source code; firmware, hypervisor, kernel, or application) analysis and also trusted computing (e.g., trusted execution environment such as SGX/SEV), and their applications to vulnerability discovery, malware analysis, and code/execution hardening. Sometimes, I also use program analysis for other studies such as measurement in order to gain insights and understanding on the security problems of interest.
  - I am a recipient of both the NSF CAREER Award and the AFOSR YIP Award. In addition to AFOSR and NSF, my research has also been supported in part by DARPA, NSA, ONR, TRC, Raytheon, and VMware.
